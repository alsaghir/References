# Sync Version Set metadata
brazil workspace sync --metadata

# To clone a package. 2 steps required
# 1- Create a workspace. 2- Use a package

# Create workspace
brazil workspace create --root <WORKSPACE_NAME>
brazil ws create -n <WORKSPACE_NAME>
# Show info
brazil workspace show
# Use version set
brazil ws use --versionSet BT101AsolymanV1/development
# Use package
brazil ws use --package BT101AsolymanV1

 # Adding package to version set is done through brazil merge. This could be done either by
brazil ws merge
# or after "https://build.amazon.com/merge" then update version set metadata in local environment
brazil ws sync â€”md
# Or do brazil use package to clone it and build it then it's seen by your workplace
# and to build your package along with other packages in the workplace
bbb

# Sync code from Gitfarm with local, specially after merge
brazil ws sync
# or
git pull

# Compile and clean built artifacts
brazil-build clean
brazil ws clean
```

- Port forwarding could be done adding the following record to `~/.ssh/config`

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/config
host devdsk
  HostName <devdskHostname>
  LocalForward 8385 127.0.0.1:8384
```
